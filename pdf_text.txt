 
Project:  Building  Your  Own  Interactive  
Data
 
Dashboard
 
In  the  professional  world,  data  scientists  often  need  to  share  their  findings  with  people  who  
aren’t
 
technical
 
(like
 
managers
 
or
 
clients).
 
Instead
 
of
 
sending
 
them
 
raw
 
code,
 
we
 
build
 
Dashboards
.
 
We
 
will
 
use
 
a
 
library
 
called
 
Streamlit
,
 
which
 
turns
 
a
 
Python
 
script
 
into
 
a
 
beautiful,
 
shareable
 
website
 
in
 
minutes.
 
1.  Setting  Up  Your  Workshop  
First,  you  need  to  install  the  "engine"  that  will  run  your  website.  
●  The  Command:  Open  your  terminal  or  command  prompt  and  type:  pip  install  
streamlit.  ●  The  Concept:  Think  of  Streamlit  as  a  translator  that  takes  your  Python  variables  and  
turns
 
them
 
into
 
buttons,
 
sliders,
 
and
 
charts
 
on
 
a
 
web
 
page.
 
 
2.  Creating  the  "Upload  Zone"  
Instead  of  hard-coding  one  specific  file,  we  want  to  make  our  tool  flexible.  
●  The  Feature:  Use  st.file_uploader.  ●  The  User  Experience:  This  creates  a  "Drag  and  Drop"  box  on  your  website.  When  a  
user
 
drops
 
a
 .csv file  there,  your  Python  code  instantly  reads  it  using  Pandas .  
 
3.  The  "Instant  Insight"  Section  
Once  the  data  is  uploaded,  your  dashboard  should  immediately  tell  the  user  what  they  are  
looking
 
at.
 
●  The  Summary:  We  use  df.describe() to  calculate  the  averages  and  ranges.  ●  The  Display:  Using  st.dataframe(df),  the  user  gets  a  clean,  scrollable  table  
(similar
 
to
 
Excel)
 
right
 
in
 
their
 
browser.
 
This
 
allows
 
them
 
to
 
"scroll
 
and
 
scan"
 
for
 
any
 
obvious
 
errors.
 
 

  
4.  Making  Charts  Interactive  (The  "Cool"  Part)  
This  is  where  Streamlit  shines.  Instead  of  showing  one  fixed  graph,  we  let  the  user  choose  
what
 
they
 
want
 
to
 
see.
 
●  The  Select  Box:  We  use  st.selectbox() to  create  a  dropdown  menu  of  all  the  
column
 
names.
 ●  Interactive  Histogram:  If  the  user  selects  "Age,"  the  graph  instantly  updates  to  show  
the
 
age
 
distribution.
 ●  Interactive  Scatter  Plot:  Give  the  user  two  dropdowns.  They  can  pick  "Income"  for  
the
 
X-axis
 
and
 
"Happiness
 
Score"
 
for
 
the
 
Y-axis
 
to
 
see
 
if
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
relationship.
 
 
5.  Bonus:  The  Correlation  Heatmap  
To  add  a  professional  touch,  you  can  include  a  "Relationship  Map."  
●  The  Logic:  Your  script  calculates  the  correlation  matrix  (the  -1  to  +1  scores  we  
discussed
 
earlier).
 ●  The  Visual:  Using  Seaborn ,  you  display  a  heatmap.  This  allows  the  user  to  look  at  
the
 
dashboard
 
and
 
instantly
 
say,
 
"Oh
 
look,
 
the
 
red
 
square
 
shows
 
that
 
'Marketing
 
Spend'
 
and
 
'Sales'
 
are
 
very
 
highly
 
correlated!"
 
 
Why  This  Project  is  a  Career  Milestone  
Building  a  Streamlit  dashboard  proves  three  things  to  potential  employers  or  teachers:  
1.  Coding  Ability:  You  can  write  functional  Python  and  use  Pandas.  2.  Visual  Literacy:  You  know  which  charts  (Histograms,  Scatter  Plots)  are  best  for  
explaining
 
data.
 3.  User  Empathy:  You  can  create  a  tool  that  is  easy  for  other  people  to  use.  This  is  the  
difference
 
between
 
a
 
"coder"
 
and
 
a
 
"data
 
scientist."
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
Project  Checklist:  
●  [  ]  Can  I  upload  a  file  without  the  app  crashing?  ●  [  ]  Does  the  "Summary  Table"  show  up  clearly?  ●  [  ]  Do  the  charts  update  automatically  when  I  change  the  dropdown  menu?  ●  [  ]  The  "Wow"  Factor:  Is  the  layout  clean  and  easy  to  read?
